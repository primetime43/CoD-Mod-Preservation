# CoD-Mod-Preservation

A long-term preservation archive for modified **Call of Duty** patches, fastfiles, and community-created modding resources.

This repository exists to document, organize, and preserve historical Call of Duty modding work that would otherwise be lost to time, dead forums, broken links, or defunct file hosts.

## 🎯 Purpose

The Call of Duty modding scene—especially during the Xbox 360 / PlayStation 3 era—produced thousands of custom patches, fastfiles, and experimental mods that are no longer easily accessible.

**CoD-Mod-Preservation** aims to:

- Preserve historically significant Call of Duty mods and patches
- Maintain original filenames, versions, and structure where possible
- Organize content by **game → console → version**
- Provide a stable reference archive for research, emulation, and educational use
